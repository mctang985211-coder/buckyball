# Run the headless verify-runner session, then adjudicate this step's exit
# code from the captured stdout (verdict-gate) and write verdict.txt — the
# Post terminal commit status step's sole source of truth.
#
# Why the indirection: dsh headless's process exit code only reflects whether
# the session completed normally (completed -> 0), not PASS/FAIL (src/prompt.ts
# contract) — the verdict is expressed by the VERDICT line of the final
# answer. So the session runs to completion first, then:
#   first ^VERDICT: (PASS|FAIL) line + session exit 0 -> verdict.txt=PASS, exit 0
#   VERDICT: FAIL                              -> verdict.txt=FAIL, exit 1
#   unparseable                                -> verdict.txt=INFRA, exit 1
# stdout is the only source of the verdict; there is no other surface to fall
# back to. PASS with a non-zero session exit is untrustworthy: no verdict.txt
# write, exit 1, and Finalize verdict files lands INFRA (terminal status=error).

# rewrites it). CI model caches are preset (~/.cache/huggingface), so go fully
# offline: huggingface_hub's offline mode short-circuits before any HTTP
# client is constructed. Consequence: a non-preset model fails deterministically
# with OfflineModeIsEnabled instead of wandering onto the network.
